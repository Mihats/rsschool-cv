                    Whilst at university I have had the opportunity to exercise my leadership qualities and put into practice many of the skills I have learned through attending English language courses. Having worked with fellow students on coursework, I have further improved my teamwork skills and enhanced my skills in presenting and extracting key information from the discussions. I learned how to adapt to different environments and communication styles by finding an individual approach to each team member, thus ensuring efficient communication within the team, In particular, I believe that some of my strengths are analytic problem solving, and being able to notice both small details as well as a bigger picture. Continuous attendance of coding workshops and courses not only demonstrates my passion for programming but also exemplifies my motivation to constantly work on improving my skill set.
